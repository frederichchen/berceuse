;; Berceuse uses plenty of codes from Prelude(https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) and
;; Steve Purcell's Emacs config(https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d) . Thanks, Steve & Bozhidar!

;;; Commentary:

;; This file gives an example of customization of Berceuse

;;; Code:

;; (setq berceuse-package-archives 'netease)   ; Package repo: melpa, melpa-mirror, emacs-china, netease, ustc, tencent or tuna
;; (setq berceuse-theme 'light)


(custom-set-variables
 ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
 )

(custom-set-faces
 ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
 )

;;; custom-example.el ends here
